# Purpose
This website is made for the 2021-2022 FBLA competition. 

# Developement

## Svelte
- Quantum chart is a svelte-based website. In the search for an ideal framework, we came across Svelte which seemed to offer nothing but benefits over other frameworks such as Next.js, Gatsby, base React, Vue, etc.

### Sveltekit
- Due to our use of Svelte, it only seemed natural to use it in coordination with Sveltekit for SSR and other important features.

## TailwindCSS
- For the CSS portion of our website, we decided to test out Tailwind. Tailwind made it incredibly easy to quickly set up custom classes for html elements while also helping us to remain consistent across the website. In hindsight, Tailwind was very helpful, but it does definietly make the sourcecode itself look very cluttered.

### TailwindUI
- Since we used Tailwind, we decided to also incorporate some of the stylistic choices from the TailwindUI license. TailwindUI was a very helpful reference, and it was nice to see examples from the creators of Tailwind.
