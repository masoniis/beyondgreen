# Purpose
This website is made by Dawson and Mason for the 2021-2022 FBLA competition. 

## What was the FBLA prompt?
- The FBLA prompt was as follows: Create a website for a new business in your local community, region, or state.
The website must include a business name, photos, and description of the
entity. The website must include a minimum of four web pages, including a
contact us page and embedded features. The website should feature social
media and marketing material to promote the new business

## What is the website about?

## Why is it software-based, and not a general business like a restaurant?
- We chose to do a software based website for a number of reasons. First and foremost, a purely software-based website gives us the ability to create fully custom graphics. If we were to do a more "normal" business, we would be forced to spend time searching for stock images and other images that make a website feel plain.

# Developement
When we signed up for the website design event at FBLA, we knew that there would be many competetitors who chose the route of Wix, Wordpress, or any similar alternatives. While we could have easily done that too, we decided to code the website from the ground up with the prioritization of our education in mind. To be straight up, we have no regrets. It was super cool to learn about web development, and we learned way more than we ever would have learned with Wix.

## Svelte
- Quantum chart is a svelte-based website. In the search for an ideal framework, we came across Svelte which seemed to offer nothing but benefits over other frameworks such as Next.js, Gatsby, base React, Vue, etc.

### Sveltekit
- Due to our use of Svelte, it only seemed natural to use it in coordination with Sveltekit for SSR and other important features.

## TailwindCSS
- For the CSS portion of our website, we decided to test out Tailwind. Tailwind made it incredibly easy to quickly set up custom classes for html elements while also helping us to remain consistent across the website. In hindsight, Tailwind was very helpful, but it does definietly make the sourcecode itself look very cluttered.

### TailwindUI
- Since we used Tailwind, we decided to also incorporate some of the stylistic choices from the TailwindUI license. TailwindUI was a very helpful reference, and it was nice to see examples from the creators of Tailwind.
